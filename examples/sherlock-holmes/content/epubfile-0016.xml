You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.&quot;</p>

Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.&quot;</p>

As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men ; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay, and very little to do.&#39;</p>
<a id='GBS.PA35.w.1.1.0'></a>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.52.1.1.box.42.697.1070.89.q.50'>&quot; &#39; But,&#39; said I,&#39; there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.&#39;</p>
<a id='GBS.PA35.w.1.2.0'></a>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.52.1.2.box.41.798.1072.440.q.60'>&quot;&#39; Not so many as you might think,&#39; he answered. &#39; You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young. and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.&#39;</p>
<a id='GBS.PA35.w.1.3.0'></a>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.52.1.3.box.41.1249.1070.481.q.60'>&quot; Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.</p>
<a id='GBS.PA35.w.1.4.0'></a>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.52.1.4.box.43.1749.1063.181.q.60'>&quot; I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk,<a id='GBS.PA36.w.1.0.0'></a>
<span class='gtxt_body' id='para.53.1.0.box.177.146.1072.680.q.60'>
and Pope&#39;s Court looked like a coster&#39;s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of color they were&#8212;straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected ; but we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.&quot;</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;' id='para.53.1.2.box.179.1047.1068.480.q.60'>&quot; There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</p>

I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.&#39; He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.</p>

But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler&#39;s wax which would disgust you with human nature.&#39; He stepped over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled.

Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.</p>

the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.</span></p>

All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes, the sleuthhound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring<a id='GBS.PA46.w.1.0.0'></a>

Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James&#39;s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming.upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.</span></p>

It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay&#39;s ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice&#39;s hair.

From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.&quot;</span></p>

That, however, was out of the question. The man&#39;s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be ? I thought of the assistant&#39;s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar &#8212; something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more ? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.</p>

Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend&#39;s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.

But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed.
